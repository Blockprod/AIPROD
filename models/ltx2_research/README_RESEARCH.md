## Usage Guidelines

**ALLOWED**:
- ✅ Study architecture patterns
- ✅ Understand design decisions
- ✅ Learn from Lightricks innovations
- ✅ Use as inspirations for novel designs
- ✅ Reference in documentation ("Inspired by LTX-2 concepts")

**NOT ALLOWED**:
- ❌ Copy model weights to AIPROD (they're Apache 2.0)
- ❌ Use code directly without modification
- ❌ Claim AIPROD is derivative of LTX-2 (it's not: reference only)
- ❌ Redistribute these files commercially

## Study Plan

### Phase 0 Research (Based on analysis):

1. **Backbone Architecture Study**
   - Document transformer design patterns
   - Note attention mechanism implementations
   - Identify optimization techniques (Flash Attention, xFormers)
   - Take notes on layer organization

2. **VAE Codec Analysis**
   - Study temporal compression strategies
   - Review latent space design
   - Note reconstruction quality trade-offs

3. **Text Encoding Integration**
   - Understand Gemma integration
   - Review embedding strategies
   - Document cross-modal fusion patterns

4. **Design Document**
   - Record findings in `AIPROD_V2_RESEARCH_NOTES.md`
   - Propose AIPROD innovations based on learnings
   - Plan completely different architecture
