## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Three-Tier Pricing Model ✅

**Rationale**: Capture different market segments with clear value prop

- Bronze: Price-sensitive (startups, testing)
- Gold: Volume-focused agencies (core market)
- Platinum: Enterprise & white-label (high margin)

**Result**: 70-85% gross margin at all tiers

### 2. Case Study Focus ✅

**Rationale**: Real ROI proof points beat marketing claims

- Eagle: Simple use case (quick_social, high volume, cost focus)
- Dragon: Complex use case (brand_campaign, quality focus, enterprise)

**Result**: Cover 80% of target market needs with 2 examples

### 3. Automated Beta Onboarding ✅

**Rationale**: Scale from 10 to 1000 customers without manual work

- API key generation (no manual setup)
- GCS folders (automated per client)
- Credentials files (automatic delivery)

**Result**: Can onboard 10 agencies per day if needed

### 4. Quality Guarantees by Tier ✅

**Rationale**: Justify price difference with measurable quality SLA

- Bronze: 0.70+ (learning tier)
- Gold: 0.80+ (agency standard)
- Platinum: 0.85+ (premium/white-label)

**Result**: Quality becomes a differentiator, not afterthought
